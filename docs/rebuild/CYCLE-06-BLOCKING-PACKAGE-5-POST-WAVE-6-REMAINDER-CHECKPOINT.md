# CYCLE 06 — PACKAGE 5 POST-WAVE-6 REMAINDER CHECKPOINT

Status: **CURRENT — accepted wave checkpoints retained; FINAL PACKAGE 5 GATE FAIL on A18/A26 production bypasses**

Date: 2026-09-04. This supersedes the Wave 6 pre-cutover remainder after the
explicit AC6 owner decision and successful production cutover from gated source
`3b54567174a0f7de45e4444241d74fba261bf0c3`.

The independent final verification starting at accepted `001bef4b` found live
Python consent SQL ownership (A18), noncanonical trial bootstrap with tenant
hard-delete cleanup (A26), and direct administrative tenant creation (A26).
See `CYCLE-06-BLOCKING-PACKAGE-5-FINAL-ADVERSARIAL-BLOCKER-REPORT.md` and its
machine-readable production inventory. No runtime was changed. The following
wave table records accepted checkpoints; it is not an aggregate no-bypass PASS.

Production release: `20260904-c06-p5-wave6-cutover-3b545671`.
Wave 6 behavioral proof remains the accepted `bf21d9d6` proof; it was not rerun.
The A30 owner is AC6 maintenance coordinator with MaintenanceRun/ItemClaim,
as classified in the Authority Gate. No new Action Engine route was introduced.

| Wave | Exact narrowed families | Production status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A22, A23 | COMPLETE |
| 2 | A16, A25, A26 | COMPLETE |
| 3 | A15, A17, A18 | COMPLETE |
| 4 | A27, A28 | COMPLETE |
| 5 | A29, A31 | COMPLETE |
| 6 | A30 | COMPLETE; six AC6 classes |

The inventory is exactly the 13 narrowed Entry Gate families, missing 0 and
extra 0. Final production-wide canonical coverage is not proven: A18 and A26
have confirmed alternate mutation paths. Preserve the six accepted wave
checkpoints; resolve the aggregate blockers without inventing another wave.

Remaining work, in order:

1. **Separately authorized aggregate blocker remediation** for the exact A18
   and A26 paths in the final blocker report. Retain D2-A/D3-A; do not invent
   new business/schema contracts or use A30 for tenant hard deletion.
2. **Resume PACKAGE 5 FINAL ADVERSARIAL VERIFICATION / COMPLETION GATE** after
   remediation. Reconcile the complete Entry Gate inventory and all
   canonical owners, including approved AC3/AC4/AC5/AC6 exceptions, against
   actual Nest, CLI, Python, maintenance and scheduler surfaces. Preserve the
   accepted authority/schema decisions, D1-A…D7-A and Common Foundation. Do not
   invent Wave 7 or require fabricated ActionExecution history for AC6.
3. Separately initiated **Final Chapter 6 Gate** after Package 5 passes.
4. After Chapter 6, a separate provenance/ownership audit of the **17 historical
   local temp/test databases**. Their deletion is not authorized by this report.

Preserve Packages 1–4, Waves 1–6 production baselines, P02/P03 holds, Client
profile/consent authority, no tenant hard delete, prospective configuration,
immutable recovery evidence, central/versioned/allowlisted retention and no
legacy mutating fallback. No broader cleanup or future legal/tenant override
contract is introduced. No real business/provider mutation for verification.
